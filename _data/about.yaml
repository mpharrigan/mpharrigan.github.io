    Undergraduate research with 
    [Geoffrey Blake](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~gab/) in 2011
    researching <i>ab-initio</i> quantum computation of
    THz vibrational modes to complement the lab's experimental
    research in terahertz spectroscopy.

    Taught (TA-ed)
    intro chem. lab (Caltech, 2011), the Caltech
    p-chem series: quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, and stat. mech.
    (2012-2013), and Stanford stat. mech. and thermo classes (2014).

    I think computation should have a greater emphasis in undergraduate
    instruction and worked with the Stanford chem curriculum chair to
    develop matlab exercises for undergraduate p-chem classes (2013).

    Enjoy programming in Python, C++, C#, and Mathematica.
    Can program in (but may not necessarily enjoy) many others.

    Hobbies include 
    flying light aircraft (private pilot since 2010), 
    jamming on my keyboard (the musical kind), 
    and mario kart (preferably double dash).
