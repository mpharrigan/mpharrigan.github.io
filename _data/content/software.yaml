    MSMBuilder is a python package which implements a series of
    statistical models for high-dimensional time-series. It is
    particularly focused on the analysis of atomistic simulations of
    biomolecular dynamics. For example, MSMBuilder has been used to model
    protein folding and conformational change from molecular dynamics (MD)
    simulations.
