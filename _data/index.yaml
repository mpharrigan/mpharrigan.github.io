  I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.
  I work with [Vijay Pande] to study protein dynamics with computation and deep learning.

  We use and develop [tools] like [OpenMM] for GPU-accelerated molecular
  dynamics and [MSMBuilder] with [MDTraj] for cutting-edge,
  statistically-motivated analysis.

  With bigger systems and longer simulations, aggressive dimensionality
  reduction is required to truly learn from simulation.
  I'm using ideas and algorithms from machine-learning to construct
  meaningful models of protein dynamics.
