  I am a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.
  I worked with [Vijay Pande] to study protein dynamics with computation and machine learning.

  The lab uses and develops [tools] like [OpenMM] for GPU-accelerated molecular
  dynamics and [MSMBuilder] with [MDTraj] for cutting-edge,
  statistically-motivated analysis.

  With bigger systems and longer simulations, aggressive dimensionality
  reduction is required to truly learn from simulation.
  I've used ideas and algorithms from machine-learning to construct
  meaningful models of protein dynamics.
