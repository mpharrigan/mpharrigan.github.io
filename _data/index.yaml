  Quantum computing promises exponential speed-up for certain computational problems---at least in theory.
  Recently, research groups around the world have began constructing research-grade quantum computers
  composed of tens of noisy qubits. [Google Quantum] is one such group, where I work writing software to unlock near-term
  quantum computing applications.

  Prior to joining Google,
  I worked at [Rigetti Computing]. Before that,
  I worked with [Vijay Pande] at Stanford to study protein dynamics with computation and machine learning.
  and developed scientific computing tools like [MSMBuilder] and [MDTraj] for analysis of molecular dynamics data.
