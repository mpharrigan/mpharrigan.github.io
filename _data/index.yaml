  I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at Stanford University.
  I work with [Vijay Pande] to study protein dynamics through computation.

  We use and develop [tools] like [OpenMM] for GPU-accelerated molecular
  dynamics and [MSMBuilder] with [MDTraj] for cutting-edge,
  statistically-motivated analysis.

  My research interests include: accelerated sampling, 
  solvent dynamics, and ion channels.

    text: Molecular dynamics offers atom-level resolution of biological
      systems at biological timescales. I'm investigating accelerated
      sampling schemes and using simulation to study novel systems of
      interest.
  - title: Analysis
    link: research/
    text: 
      With bigger systems and longer simulations, aggressive analysis is
      needed to make sense of this fire hose of timeseries data.
      We're using ideas from statistics and machine-learning to construct
      meaningful models of protein dynamics.
