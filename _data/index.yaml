  I currently write quantum software for [Rigetti Computing] in Berkeley, California.
  Prior to that,
  I worked with [Vijay Pande] at Stanford to study protein dynamics with computation and machine learning.

  With domains as complex as biophysics or quantum information, scientific computing [tools] are
  essential for modern research.
  I help develop some of these tools like [MSMBuilder] and [MDTraj] for analysis of molecular dynamics data
  and [PyQuil] for quantum programming.
