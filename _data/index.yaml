  Quantum computing promises exponential speed-up for certain computational problems---at least in theory.
  Recently, physics labs around the world have began constructing near-term intermediate-scale quantum computers
  composed of tens of noisy qubits. One such lab can be found at [Rigetti Computing] in Berkeley, California
  where I work writing software
  like [pyQuil] to explore and develop algorithms on these machines.

  Prior to joining Rigetti,
  I worked with [Vijay Pande] at Stanford to study protein dynamics with computation and machine learning.
  and developed scientific computing tools like [MSMBuilder] and [MDTraj] for analysis of molecular dynamics data.
