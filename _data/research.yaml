    I'm using tools and algorithms borrowed from recent work in deep learning to
    build better models for protein dynamics.
  content: |+
    A side effect of the recent boom in deep learning has been the proliferation
    of well-engineered [libraries][tensorflow] for performing arbitrary symbolic differentiation.
    I'm using these tools to enrich our current dynamical modeling techniques.

    In addition, I'm investigating the use of deep networks to find
    better feature representations of biomolecules.

    Sodium channels initiate signaling in neurons and other cells which go on
    to become sensations of pleasure and pain, as well as thoughts and
    feelings.  Potassium channels return excitable cells to normalcy.

    In collaboration with the [duBois] lab and with the help of
    [Folding@Home], we are conducting large scale molecular dynamics study of
    a voltage gated sodium channel to complement experimental work to
    probe sodium channel function through the use of natural
    toxins secreted by frogs in the Amazon rain forest.  

    In collaboration with [Pfizer] and [Folding@Home], we studied a
    mechanosensative potassium channel transitioning between stretched
    and compressed conformations.

- title: Markov Modeling

  lead: |+
    Our lab develops and applies novel statistical techniques to
    understand and interpret the huge volume of data returned from a
    molecular dynamics study. 
  content: |+
    Particularly, we use Markov state models
    (MSMs) and time-structure-based independent component analysis (tICA)
    to draw interpretable conclusions from large timeseries data sets.

    I've introduced a new method for including solvent degrees of freedom
    in MSM analysis described in this [paper][shellspaper].

    I've introduced a computationally tractable form of non-linear tICA
    that is analogous to an MSM with soft states [here][lkticapaper].
