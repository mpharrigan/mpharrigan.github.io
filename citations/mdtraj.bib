    abstract = {Summary: MDTraj is a modern, lightweight and efficient
        software package for analyzing molecular dynamics simulations.
            MDTraj reads trajectory data from a wide variety of commonly
            used formats. It provides a large number of trajectory analysis
            capabilities including RMSD, DSSP secondary structure
            assignment and the extraction of common order parameters. The
            package has a strong focus on interoperability with the wider
            scientific Python ecosystem, bridging the gap between molecular
            dynamics data and the rapidly-growing collection of
            industry-standard statistical analysis and visualization tools
            in Python. Availability: Package downloads, detailed examples
            and full documentation are available at http://mdtraj.org. The
