    abstract = "Abstract As molecular dynamics (MD) simulations continue to
        evolve into powerful computational tools for studying complex
        biomolecular systems, the necessity of flexible and easy-to-use
        software tools for the analysis of these simulations is growing. We
        have developed MDTraj, a modern, lightweight, and fast software
        package for analyzing \{MD\} simulations. \{MDTraj\} reads and
        writes trajectory data in a wide variety of commonly used formats.
        It provides a large number of trajectory analysis capabilities
        including minimal root-mean-square-deviation calculations,
        secondary structure assignment, and the extraction of common order
        parameters. The package has a strong focus on interoperability with
        the wider scientific Python ecosystem, bridging the gap between
        \{MD\} data and the rapidly growing collection of industry-standard
        statistical analysis and visualization tools in Python.  \{MDTraj\}
        is a powerful and user-friendly software package that simplifies the
        analysis of \{MD\} data and connects these datasets with the modern
        interactive data science software ecosystem in Python. "
