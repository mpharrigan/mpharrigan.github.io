abstract = { Molecular dynamics with explicit solvent is favored for its
    ability to more correctly simulate aqueous biological processes and has
        become routine thanks to increasingly powerful computational
        resources. However, analysis techniques including Markov state
        models (MSMs) ignore solvent atoms and focus solely on solute
        coordinates despite solvent being implicated in myriad biological
        phenomena. We present a unified framework called “solvent-shells
        featurization” for including solvent degrees of freedom in analysis
        and show that this method produces better models. We apply this
        method to simulations of dewetting in the two-domain protein BphC
        to generate a predictive MSM and identify functional water
        molecules.  Furthermore, the proposed methodology could be easily
        extended for building MSMs of any systems with indistinguishable
        components. }
