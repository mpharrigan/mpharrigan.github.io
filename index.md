I am a PhD student in the Department of Chemistry at
Stanford University. I work with [Vijay Pande] to
study protein dynamics through computation.

We use
[tools] like [OpenMM] for GPU-accelerated molecular
dynamics and [MSMBuilder] with [MDTraj] for cutting-edge,
statistically-motivated analysis.

My research interests include: accelerated sampling, 
solvent dynamics, and voltage-gated sodium channels.
