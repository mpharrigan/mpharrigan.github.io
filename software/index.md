# MSMBuilder

MSMBuilder is a python package which implements a series of
statistical models for high-dimensional time-series. It is
particularly focused on the analysis of atomistic simulations of
biomolecular dynamics. For example, MSMBuilder has been used to model
protein folding and conformational change from molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations.

Check out the [documentation][msmbdoc] and GitHub
[repository][msmbrepo] for more.

### Wetmsm

`wetmsm` functions as a plugin for MSMBuilder. It implements the
"solvent shells" metric for investigating water, lipids, and other
solvents in the MSM framework. It's available [here][wetmsmrepo]

# MDTraj

MDTraj is a python library that allows researchers to read, write and
analyze any of the dazzling array of MD formats in common use. Check
out the [documentation][mdtrajdoc] and GitHub [repository][mdtrajrepo]
for more.
