MSMBuilder is a python package which implements a series of
statistical models for high-dimensional time-series. It is
particularly focused on the analysis of atomistic simulations of
biomolecular dynamics. For example, MSMBuilder has been used to model
protein folding and conformational change from molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations.


### Wetmsm

[GitHub](https://github.com/mpharrigan/wetmsm)

`wetmsm` functions as a plugin for MSMBuilder. It implements the
"solvent shells" metric for investigating water, lipids, and other
solvents in the MSM framework.
